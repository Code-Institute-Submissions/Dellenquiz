                        <p>Dellenquiz is a promotion of the surroundings with its beautiful nature, events and inhabitants around the North and South Dellen and its closest neighbours. 
                            You will find questions for interesting historical and geographical facts, places to visit, the inhabitants or just good to know information.
                        </p>
                        <p>Test your knowledge and hopefully you will even find things you didn't know before.
                            With clicking on the Start button the first question with four (4) choices will be shown. If nothing else is mentioned then only one choice is correct. 
                            You will not get any feedback until you answer the last question and hopefully all will be correct otherwise you can Restart the quiz and try as many times
                            you want. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
